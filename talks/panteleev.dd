TALK_TITLE = Web Development in D

LEVEL = Basic, Intermediate

BENEFITS =
A thorough Introduction to D web development and related technologies.

ABSTRACT =
With its speed, safety, and expressiveness, D excels for web
development. However, D is not yet thought of as a compelling choice
in that area. The best D tools and techniques for web development are
young and not well known at this time. This talk will fix that by
providing an overview of the web development libraries, solutions and
techniques available to D users today.

BIO =
Vladimir Panteleev (a.k.a. "CyberShadow") is a
D enthusiast from Moldova (Eastern Europe), best known
within the D community for DFeed, the web newsreader (and
IRC bot) running on $(LINK http://forum.dlang.org).
